N = lentgh of time series 
M = number of time series

W = 10% * N

batch_mid

missingpercentage   | N = max; M = max; size of a single single block varies between 10% and 80% of the series, position: at 5% of 1st series from the top.
length              | M = max; N varies between 20% and 100% of the series. size of a single missing block is 10% * N, position: at 5% of 1st series from the top.
columns             | N = max; M = varies from min(10% of columns, 4) to 100% of columns; size of a single missing block is W, position: at 5% of 1st series from the top.
multicol-disjoint   | N = max; M = max; Missing data - size = N/M, position: in each time series = column_index * size
multicol-overlap    | N = max; M = max; Missing data - size = 2 * N/M for all columns except last; last column = N/M; position: in each time series = column_index * (size/2)
mcar-ts-block       | N = max; M = max; Missing data - 10 to 100% time series are incomplete; Missing blocks - size = 10, removed from a random series at a random position until a total of W of all points of time series are missing.
blackout            | N = max; M = max; Missing data - 10 to 100 rows in each time series, position: at 5% of all series from the top.
fullcolumn          | N = max; M = max; Missing data - 1 to 10 full time series from the end.

* all mcar scenarios use random number generator with fixed seed and will produce the same blocks every run
