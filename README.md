## Prerequisites and dependencies

- Ubuntu 16 or Ubuntu 18 (including Ubuntu derivatives, e.g., Xubuntu).
- Clone this repository.
- Mono: Install mono from https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/ (takes few minutes).

___

## Build

- Build all the Testing Framework using the installation script located in the root folder (takes ~1min):
```bash
    $ sh install_linux.sh
```

___

## Execution


```bash
    $ cd TestingFramework/bin/Debug/
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe [arguments]
```

### Arguments

 | -alg  | -d  |  -scen 
 | -------- | -------- | -------- |
 | cdrec    | airq        | miss_perc |
 | dynammo  | bafu        | ts_length |
 | grouse   | chlorine    | ts_nbr    |
 | rosl     | climate     | miss_disj |
 | softimp  | drift10     | miss_over |
 | svdimp   | electricity | mcar      |
 | svt      | meteo       | blackout  |
 | stmvl    | temp        | *all*     |
 | spirit   | bafu_red    |           |
 | tenmf    | drift10_red |           |
 | tkcm     | *all*       |           |
 | trmf     |             |           |
 | *all*    |             |           |



### Results
All results will be added to `Results` folder. The accuracy results and plots of all algorithms will be sequentially added for each scenario and dataset to: `Results/../../error/`. The runtime results and plots of all algorithms will be added to: `Results/../../runtime/`. 


### Execution examples

1. Run the whole benchmark (all algorithms, all datasets, all scenarios, precision and runtime)
```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe -alg all -d all -scen all
```
**Warning**: Running the whole benchmark will take a sizeable amount of time (up to 4 days depending on the hardware) and will produce up to 15GB of output files with all recovered data and plots unless stopped early.

2. Run a single algorithm (spirit) on a single dataset (airq) using one scenario (missing percentage)
```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe -alg spirit -d airq -scen miss_perc
```

3. Run two algorithms (spirit, grouse) on a single dataset (airq) using one scenario (missing percentage)
```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe -alg spirit,grouse -d airq -scen miss_perc
```

4. Run point 3 without runtime results
```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe -alg spirit,grouse -d airq -scen miss_perc -nort
```

5. Additional command-line parameters
```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe --help
```

- *Remarks*:
    - The algorithms `tkcm` and `spirit` cannot handle multiple incomplete time series. These two allgorithms are not compatible with resp. scenarios `miss_disj`, `miss_over`, `mcar` and `blackout`.

## Parametrized execution

- You can parametrize each algorithm using the command `-algx`. For example, you can run
the svdimp algorithm with a reduction value of 4 on the drift dataset and by varying the sequence length as follows:

```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe -algx svdimp 4 -d drift10 -scen ts_nbr
```

- If you want to run some algorithms with default parameters, and some with customized ones, you can use `-alg` and `-algx` together. For example, you can run stmvl algorithm with default parameter and cdrec algorithm with a reduction value of 4 on the airq dataset and by varying the sequence length as follows:

```bash
    $ mono TestingFramework.exe -alg stmvl -algx cdrec 4 -d airq -scen ts_nbr
```

- Remark: The command `-algx` cannot be run in group and should preceed the name of each algorithm.


## Datasets customization

- All the datasets used in this paper can be found in:  `TestingFramework/bin/Debug/data/`
- To a new add a dataset to the benchmark
  - import the file to `TestingFramework/bin/Debug/data/{name}/{name}_normal.txt` (`name` is the name of your data).
  - Requirements: rows>= 1'000, columns>= 10, column separator: empty space, row separator: newline
